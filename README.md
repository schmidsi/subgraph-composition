# 🛠️ Combining Multiple Subgraphs with Graph Client

[![Cover Image](cover.png)](https://bit.ly/47afnwj)

## Problem statement

Subgraphs that are published to The Graph Network can either be published to The Graph Smart Contracts on Arbitrum One or Ethereum Mainnet. In order to have an overview over all subgraphs on The Graph Network we need to combine the data from both chains. This is a common problem in the blockchain space: Many protocols have smart contracts on multiple chains.

While reading this, it might be a bit confusing as we talk about "subgraphs" as the thing that is published to The Graph Network, but also a way to read from the blockchain, since we are using The Graph Network subgraphs as an example.

### Get an API Key for The Graph

Go to: https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/

--> `dc9b1200d80a1c064c90462b9c04f264` This is mine, you should create your own.

### Find the subgraphs that we want to query

- https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/DjUVVVSuKcCCTZSVzVXLioSd7AdqwGEyBrY4Ru5tuqzX?view=Playground&chain=arbitrum-one
- https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/AwyZBdna4vTAHiqBWsrQ5ErFRMi6HCgGEkQMgNBseWTL?view=Playground&chain=arbitrum-one

1. Let's start with one. Get the query URL:

`https://gateway-arbitrum.network.thegraph.com/api/[api-key]/subgraphs/id/AwyZBdna4vTAHiqBWsrQ5ErFRMi6HCgGEkQMgNBseWTL`

2. Replace `[api-key]` with your API key:

`https://gateway-arbitrum.network.thegraph.com/api/dc9b1200d80a1c064c90462b9c04f264/subgraphs/id/AwyZBdna4vTAHiqBWsrQ5ErFRMi6HCgGEkQMgNBseWTL`

### Initalize Graph Client

Learn more about Graph Client: https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-client/

1. Install GraphQL dependencies in nextjs folder

```bash
cd packages/nextjs
yarn add graphql
```

2. Install the Graph Client CLI locally (this is different from Graph CLI)

```bash
yarn add -D @graphprotocol/client-cli
```

3. Create the configuration file ([example](./packages/nextjs/.graphclientrc.yml))):

```yml
# .graphclientrc.yml
sources:
  - name: mainnet
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: https://gateway-arbitrum.network.thegraph.com/api/dc9b1200d80a1c064c90462b9c04f264/subgraphs/id/AwyZBdna4vTAHiqBWsrQ5ErFRMi6HCgGEkQMgNBseWTL
```

4. Run the Graph Client development server:

```bash
yarn graphclient serve-dev
```

5. Open Graph Client GraphiQL in your browser (should happen automatically):

http://localhost:4000/

### Hook up Graph Client to React

Let's start with a simple query and hook it to React:

```graphql
query Subgraphs {
  subgraphs(
    first: 10
    orderBy: currentSignalledTokens
    orderDirection: desc
    where: { entityVersion: 2 }
  ) {
    id
    metadata {
      displayName
    }
  }
}
```

_hint_: Be sure to use named queries (`query Subgraphs {}`) instead of anonymous queries (`{}`) because Graph Client does not support anonymous queries.

_note_: The `where: { entityVersion: 2 }` filter is an implementation detail that only applies to that particular subgraph. For other subgraphs, this is not needed.

1. Get a query

Type this query in the GraphiQL interface and hit the play button to see the result.

http://localhost:4000/graphql?query=%7B%0A++subgraphs+%7B%0A++++metadata+%7B%0A++++++displayName%0A++++%7D%0A++%7D%0A%7D

![GraphiQL](explorer-graphiql.png)

We can use the GraphiQL explorer to build a more complex query. Just click on the folder icon in the right sidebar to open it. In fact, this is a great tool to explore the data that is available in the subgraph. We can play around with it until we find a good query.

2. Store the query in a file

With Graph Client, we can separate GraphQL queries from our React components. This is a good practice because it makes our code more readable and maintainable. I suggest to use the path: [`./packages/nextjs/queries/Subgraphs.graphql`](./packages/nextjs/queries/Subgraphs.graphql). Also, Graph Client generates TypeScript types for us, so we can use them in our React components.

And then extend [`.graphclientrc.yml`](./packages/nextjs/.graphclientrc.yml) with the following:

```yml
# other content
documents:
  - "./queries/**/*.graphql"
```

3. Build Graph Client helper files

```bash
yarn graphclient build
```

This generates a bunch of helper files, located by default in [`.graphclient/`](./packages/nextjs/.graphclient/) folder.

4. Run a query in React

Open up [`./packages/nextjs/pages/index.tsx`](./packages/nextjs/pages/index.tsx) and change it to the following code:

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { ExecutionResult } from "graphql";
import type { NextPage } from "next";
import { SubgraphsDocument, SubgraphsQuery, execute } from "~~/.graphclient";
import { MetaHeader } from "~~/components/MetaHeader";

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  // `SubgraphsQuery` is generated by Graph Client and contains the types for our query.
  // This comes very handy later while developing
  const [result, setResult] = useState<ExecutionResult<SubgraphsQuery>>();

  // Simple React hook to run the query on page load
  useEffect(() => {
    execute(SubgraphsDocument, {}).then((result) => {
      setResult(result);
      console.log(result);
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <MetaHeader />
      <div className="flex items-center flex-col flex-grow pt-10">
        <div className="px-5">
          <h1 className="text-center">
            <span className="block text-4xl font-bold">Query The Graph</span>
          </h1>
        </div>

        <div className="flex-grow bg-base-300 w-full mt-16 px-8 py-12">
          <ul>
            {result?.data?.subgraphs.map((subgraph) => (
              <li>{subgraph.metadata?.displayName}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

_hint_: In the example above, we use the bare functions provided by Graph Client directly. Graph Client also nicely integrates with [Apollo](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-client/tree/main/examples/apollo), [URQL](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-client/blob/main/examples/urql) and [React Query](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-client/blob/main/examples/react-query).

Now we can navigate to http://localhost:3000/ and see a list of subgraph names.

### Combine multiple subgraphs

So far, we enjoyed the increased developer experience by having generated types for our queries and separation of concerns with GraphQL queries in separate files. But we haven't really combined multiple subgraphs yet. Let's do that now.

1. Add another subgraph to the configuration file

```yml
# .graphclientrc.yml
sources:
  - name: mainnet
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: https://gateway-arbitrum.network.thegraph.com/api/dc9b1200d80a1c064c90462b9c04f264/subgraphs/id/AwyZBdna4vTAHiqBWsrQ5ErFRMi6HCgGEkQMgNBseWTL

  # this is new 👇
  - name: arbitrum
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: https://gateway-arbitrum.network.thegraph.com/api/dc9b1200d80a1c064c90462b9c04f264/subgraphs/id/DjUVVVSuKcCCTZSVzVXLioSd7AdqwGEyBrY4Ru5tuqzX
# ... rest of the file
```

2. Extend the schema

A fundemantal idea of schema stiching is that we can extend a GraphQL schema. Graph Client supports this too and makes it as simple as possible. We can now extend the schema to add some cross-chain fields.

Add the following lines to [`.graphclientrc.yml`](./packages/nextjs/.graphclientrc.yml):

```yml
additionalTypeDefs: |
  enum CHAIN {
    ARBITRUM
    MAINNET
  }

  extend type Subgraph {
    deployedChain: CHAIN
  }

  extend type Query {
    crossSubgraphs(skip: Int = 0, first: Int, orderBy: Subgraph_orderBy, orderDirection: OrderDirection, where: Subgraph_filter, block: Block_height): [Subgraph!]!
  }
```

In the code above, we first define an `enum` that helps to identify on which chain a subgraph is deployed. Then we extend the `Subgraph` type with a new field `deployedChain`. Finally, we extend the root `Query` type with a new field `crossSubgraphs` that allows us to query subgraphs across chains. Note that the arguments to `crossSubgraphs` is the same as `subgraphs`: `skip`, `first`, `orderBy`, `orderDirection`, `where` and `block`.

3. Reference the custom resolvers

In order to make the new fields work, we need to add custom resolvers. Add the following lines to [`.graphclientrc.yml`](./packages/nextjs/.graphclientrc.yml):

```yml
additionalResolvers:
  - ./utils/graphclient/resolvers.ts
```

This instructs Graph Client to load custom resolvers from [./utils/graphclient/resolvers.ts](./utils/graphclient/resolvers.ts).

4. Implement the custom resolvers

Create the file [./utils/graphclient/resolvers.ts](./utils/graphclient/resolvers.ts) with the following content:

```ts
import { Resolvers } from "../../.graphclient";

const chains = ["arbitrum", "mainnet"];

export const resolvers: Resolvers = {
  Query: {
    crossSubgraphs: async (root: any, args: any, context: any, info: any) => {
      console.log("crossSubgraphs", root, args, context, info);

      const results = await Promise.all(
        chains.map((source) =>
          context[source].Query.subgraphs({
            root,
            args,
            context,
            info,
          }).then((subgraphs: any) =>
            subgraphs.map((subgraph: any) => ({
              ...subgraph,
              deployedChain: source.toUpperCase(),
            }))
          )
        )
      ).then((allSubgraphs) => allSubgraphs.flat());

      return results;
    },
  },
};
```

This simple resolver just sends the same query to both subgraphs and combines the results. Note that we also add the `deployedChain` field to the result. This is a very simple example. In a real-world example you might want to implement more logic to sort the results properly.

### Query the new combined field

1. Change the query to use the new field

```graphql
query Subgraphs {
  crossSubgraphs(
    first: 10
    orderBy: currentSignalledTokens
    orderDirection: desc
    where: { entityVersion: 2 }
  ) {
    id
    deployedChain
    metadata {
      displayName
    }
  }
}
```

_Note_: We changed the query from `subgraphs` to `crossSubgraphs` but kept the arguments. Also, we now query the `deployedChain` field.

2. Rebuild Graph Client helper files

```bash
yarn graphclient build
```

3. Change the React code to use the new query

```tsx
<ul>
  {result?.data?.crossSubgraphs.map((subgraph) => (
    <li key={subgraph.id}>
      {subgraph.metadata?.displayName} - {subgraph.deployedChain}
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

Note that the filed is now named `crossSubgraphs` and we also display the `deployedChain` field.

### Add prefixes

Although we have a unified schema, one problem that we now have is that there is a clash in top level queries. If we send a simple query like:

```graphql
{
  subgraphs(first: 1) {
    id
    deployedChain
    metadata {
      displayName
    }
  }
}
```

The field `deployedChain` is undefined and we don't know how from which subgraph this result is. One possible solution would be to [leverage the transformation feature](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-client/tree/097cd595d0efdf71af57b7595e47e7bdddddc5fa/examples/transforms) and prefix all top-level fields with the chain name. To do this, we need to install the `transform-prefix` package

```bash
yarn add @graphql-mesh/transform-prefix
```

And then change tell Graph Client to use it in [`.graphclientrc.yml`](./packages/nextjs/.graphclientrc.yml):

```yml
sources:
  - name: mainnet
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: https://gateway-arbitrum.network.thegraph.com/api/dc9b1200d80a1c064c90462b9c04f264/subgraphs/id/AwyZBdna4vTAHiqBWsrQ5ErFRMi6HCgGEkQMgNBseWTL

    transforms: # new 👇
      - prefix:
          value: arbitrum_
          includeRootOperations: true
          includeTypes: false

  - name: arbitrum
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: https://gateway-arbitrum.network.thegraph.com/api/dc9b1200d80a1c064c90462b9c04f264/subgraphs/id/DjUVVVSuKcCCTZSVzVXLioSd7AdqwGEyBrY4Ru5tuqzX

    transforms: # new 👇
      - prefix:
          value: arbitrum_
          includeRootOperations: true
          includeTypes: false
# ... rest of the file
```

Running `yarn graphclient serve-dev` again and inspecting the schema shows, that all top-level fields are now prefixed with the chain name. So the simple query from above would look like this now:

```graphql
{
  arbitrum_subgraphs(first: 1) {
    id
    deployedChain
    metadata {
      displayName
    }
  }
}
```

But the `crossSubgraphs` query does not work anymore. We need to change the resolver to use the new prefixed fields:

From `context[source].Query.subgraphs` to `` context[source].Query[\`${source}\_subgraphs\`] ``

```ts
import { Resolvers } from "../../.graphclient";

const chains = ["arbitrum", "mainnet"];

export const resolvers: Resolvers = {
  Query: {
    crossSubgraphs: async (root: any, args: any, context: any, info: any) => {
      // console.log("crossSubgraphs", root, args, context, info);
      console.log(Object.keys(context.arbitrum.Query));

      const results = await Promise.all(
        chains.map((source) =>
          context[source].Query[`${source}_subgraphs`]({
            // <- here the query is prefixed too
            root,
            args,
            context,
            info,
          }).then((subgraphs: any) =>
            subgraphs.map((subgraph: any) => ({
              ...subgraph,
              deployedChain: source.toUpperCase(),
            }))
          )
        )
      ).then((allSubgraphs) => allSubgraphs.flat());

      return results;
    },
  },
};
```

## Conclusion

We now learned how to combine the schema of multiple subgraphs together and create custom resolvers on top of that.

## Caveats

### Re-run Graph Client build every time

If you change the queries or configuration files, always rebuild the Graph Client helper files:

```bash
yarn graphclient build
```

### Graph Client dev server messes up the build files

If you ever see this error in your terminal:

```
error - ./node_modules/@graphql-mesh/cli/node_modules/ts-node/dist-raw/node-internal-modules-cjs-helpers.js:35:0
Module not found: Can't resolve 'module'
```

Then you need to rebuild the Graph Client helper files:

```bash
yarn graphclient build
```

## Notes

Complete query:

```graphql
{
  subgraphs(
    first: 1000
    orderBy: currentSignalledTokens
    orderDirection: desc
    where: { entityVersion: 2 }
  ) {
    active
    createdAt
    creatorAddress
    currentSignalledTokens
    id
    migrated
    oldID
    updatedAt
    versionCount
    currentVersion {
      createdAt
      entityVersion
      id
      metadataHash
      version
      subgraphDeployment {
        id
        originalName
        ipfsHash
      }
    }
    metadata {
      id
      image
      nftImage
      website
      description
      displayName
      codeRepository
    }
  }
}
```
